The Eternal Word

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the
beginning with God. 3 All things were made
through Him, and without Him nothing was made
that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life
was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

John’s Witness: The True Light

6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of
the Light, that all through him might believe.
8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness
of that Light. 9 That[b] was the true Light which gives
light to every man coming into the world.

10 He was in the world, and the world was made
through Him, and the world did not know Him.
11 He came to His [c]own, and His [d]own did not receive Him.
12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the
right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:
13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

The Word Becomes Flesh

14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ ”

16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
